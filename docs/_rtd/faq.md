## FAQ

### I got an error when running the notebook

The functions in `ark` have a lot of error checking built in. This means that if any of the arguments are wrong, you will get a ValueError of some kind. There's a good chance that the error message will tell you in very direct terms what the problem is, so please carefully read the error message. 

For example, if you get an invalid path error, the error message indicate which part of the path doesn't exist, helping you to troubleshoot. 

If you're still stuck, please completely close the notebook, and restart everything. If you've exhausted all of these options and are still getting the same error, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis/issues/new/choose).
