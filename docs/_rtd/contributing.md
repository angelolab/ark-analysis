## Contributing to ark-analysis
Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source project! Below are some helpful guidelines which describe our workflow. This should help you get up to speed and oriented to our project. 

### Step 1: Identify an issue to work on  
Issues are how we keep track of known bugs, areas that can be improved, and community suggestsions for new features. Before writing any code, you should first identify an issue which describes the problem you'd like to address. Our list of currently open issues is displayed on our [project overview page](https://github.com/orgs/angelolab/projects/2). This page allows us to track the progress of the different issues being worked on. When are issues are first created, they get assigned to the **To Do** column. Once our team has reviewed the issue and decided on how to address the problem, it will get moved to the **Current tasks** column. This means that the issue is available and ready to be worked on by anyoen who wants to contribute. If you're looking for a good place to get started, this column has tasks that have not yet been claimed by anyone. 

If you have your own idea for an improvement or change you'd like to make, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis/issues) describing your idea. This issue will then get added to the **To Do** column, and once approved, moved to **Current tasks**

### Step 2: Assign yourself to the selected issue
Once you've identified the issue in **Current tasks** that you'd like to work on, make sure to carefully read through the description to ensure you understand the problem and the proposed solution. If you have any questions, bring those up now, before diving in. 

Then, once you're sure you understand the task, you can assign yourself to the issue by clicking on the **Assignees** tab on the right hand side of the issue. You should then move the issue to **In progress** on the project tracking board. This lets everyone know that you've decided to work on this issue, and prevents duplication of work. 

### Step 3: Create a local branch to hold your changes. 
In order to keep track of the many different improvements that are being worked on at once, we use different branches in git. This keeps these changes isolated from each other during development. 

If you'd like a refersher on using git and why it's useful, check out [this git reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). If you'd like an overview on collaborating via github, check out [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)

### Step 4: Coding time
Now that you're ready to get to work, you can make the necessary modifications to our codebase to address your issue. 

There are a few important details to keep in mind as you're writing your code. The first is that we follow [the google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for python code. It's good to take a look through here if you aren't familiar with it, to get a sense for what we  expect. You can also look through our [source code](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis/tree/master/ark) to see how we've implemented these suggestions

The second important concept is [modular code]. Breaking your code up into small pieces will make it easier to read, easier to understand, and easier to reuse. Before submitting your PR, take a look through your code to see if it could be broken up into smaller, logical pieces that work together, rather than a few large chunks that do everything at once. 

The third important concept is [testing](https://realpython.com/python-testing/). All of the code that gets added to our repository must be tested! This allows us to make sure that it's working as intended. Even more importantly, it means that if someone makes a change in the future that causes the code to break, we'll identify that problem during the pull-request stage, where it can be fixed. Once you've finished creating your code, it's important to write test functions to ensure that it's behaving as expected. For an example of what that looks like, you can take a look at our [data_utils](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis/blob/master/ark/utils/data_utils.py) and the [associated test code](https://github.com/angelolab/ark-analysis/blob/master/ark/utils/data_utils_test.py). 

### Step 5: Submit your code to be reviewed
Once you think you have a version that's ready for us to look at, you can submit a pull request for us to look at. For more details on how this works, see the [previous link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) on using github. 

Pull requests allow us to look at proposed changes, and give feedback prior to integrating them into the main version of the repo that everyone is using. After you open a new pull request, a number of automatic checks will run. For example, you might see an error message from Travis indicating the build failed:

This means that some of the tests didn't pass. You can click on the link for more information about which tests specifically failed. 

Once all of the tests have passed, you should request a review from someone on our team. Chances are, the person who you were communicating with on the linked issue is the best person to review your PR.

### Step 6: Respond to review comments
No one writes perfect code the first time. Chances are, your reviewer will have some suggested changes for your code. Take the time to carefully read through their comments, and make sure to ask any clarifying questions. Then, once you understand what's being asked of you, update your PR with the requested changes. You can continue to make commits to the existing branch that you used to create your PR. As you push new commits to that branch, the PR will automatically update, and Travis will automatically re-run to test this new code. Once you've addressed the comments made during review, you can click the 're-request review' button on the top. Once your reviewer is satisfied with your changes, they will approve your PR and merge it into the master branch. 

Thanks in advance for contributing to our project!
