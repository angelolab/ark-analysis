ARK
===============================

This is ARK for ya.

We're doing some cool stuff with medical imaging.

Want to get started? Just follow our :ref:`quickstart-label` guide!

.. _quickstart-label:

Quickstart

.. mdinclude:: ../README.md

Table of Contents

.. We're talkin' 'bout ARK code here.::

..     print('hello world')
..     >> hello world

.. The table of contents has a sample file for you to look at. It should be parsed correctly with recommonmark configured in conf.py. Unfortunately, I could not include the example of an image :-(, but you probably already know how that works in Markdown.
