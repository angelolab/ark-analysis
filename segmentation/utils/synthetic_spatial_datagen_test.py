        # matrix symmetry: a property of distance matrices
        # mean AB > mean AC: the mean distance between cells of types A and B
        # is greater than that of types A and C

    # than the average of the distance between A and C.
    # this may not eliminate the possibility that the null is proved true
    # but it's definitely a great check that can ensure greater success
