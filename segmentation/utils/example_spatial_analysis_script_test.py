# This script takes a cell expression matrix, label maps for the fovs to be included in the analysis, and, depending
# on the analysis, a threshold matrix for channel or cluster spatial analysis. In channel spatial analysis, cells for
# a specific fov are identified, and cells of particular phenotypes are compared to each other to check for positive,
# negative, or no enrichment. To do this, a distance matrix is created from the label_maps, cell phenotypes are
# identified by their labels in the image and then significant interactions between different populations of phenotypes
# are recorded. Similar analysis is also done for channel spatial enrichment; however, instead of looking at cell
# phenotypes, markers positive for specific thresholds are identified and specific interactions are then characterized
# between them.
